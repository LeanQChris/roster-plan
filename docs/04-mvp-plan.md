# MVP Plan

This document defines the **Minimum Viable Product** — the smallest shippable version that delivers core value: a manager can create shifts, assign people, and everyone can see the schedule.

---

## MVP Scope (What's In)

### Core Workflow
```
Sign up company → Add teams → Invite employees
  → Create shift templates with recurrence
  → Expand & publish schedule for a date range
  → Assign employees to shifts
  → Employees log in and view their schedule
```

### Features Kept
| Feature | Rationale |
|---|---|
| Multi-tenant auth | Required for any value |
| Company settings | Required for setup |
| Teams CRUD | Required for org structure |
| People CRUD + invite | Required to have employees |
| Shift templates + RRULE | Core value — recurring schedules |
| Shift instances + publish | Core value — making schedule live |
| Manager assigns shifts | Core value — who works when |
| Basic calendar view | Core value — see the schedule |
| 1 notification email | Essential feedback loop (shift assigned) |
| Role gating (admin/manager/employee) | Security, but simplified |

### Features Deferred (MVP+)
| Feature | Why Deferred |
|---|---|
| Self-scheduling (employee picks shifts) | Manager-assign is simpler, unblocks initial use |
| Self-scheduling approvals workflow | Builds on self-scheduling |
| Clock in / out | Separate concern, adds scope |
| Time-off / leave requests | Requires approval workflow, separate from scheduling |
| Shift swaps / trades | Builds on shift assignments, requires conflict detection |
| Positions CRUD | Nice-to-have, shifts can be created without named positions |
| Skills / Certifications | Qualification tracking adds scope; MVP doesn't validate skill match |
| Locations / Sites | Single-site assumption is sufficient for first users |
| Attendance reports | Needs clock data |
| Calendar export (iCal / webcal) | Nice-to-have, not critical for first users |
| Notification upgrades (reminders, digest, preferences, Slack/Teams) | Single notification email is sufficient for MVP |
| Integrations (Slack/Teams/Google Calendar) | Manual scheduling flow doesn't need external integrations |
| Timezone toggle | Single company TZ is sufficient for MVP |
| Coverage heatmap | Visualization polish |
| Conflict detection UI | Server-side validation only (no fancy UI) |
| Audit log UI | Store it, don't show it yet |
| Compliance features | Wire up encryption, defer UI/policies |
| Password reset | Deferred to MVP+ |
| Rate limiting | Deferred to hardening phase |
| Webcal subscription | Deferred with calendar export |

---

## Data Model (MVP Subset)

Only these tables are needed for MVP. The full schema in `db/02-schema.sql` has more; MVP uses a flattened subset.

| Table | MVP? | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `companies` | ✅ | Full as designed |
| `company_settings` | ✅ | Required |
| `teams` | ✅ | Full |
| `people` | ✅ | Full |
| `team_memberships` | ❌ | Cross-team assign deferred; primary team is sufficient |
| `shift_templates` | ✅ | Full |
| `recurrence_rules` | ✅ | Full RRULE support |
| `shifts` | ✅ | Full + simplified — no `draft`/`published` workflow for MVP |
| `shift_assignments` | ✅ | Simplified: status is always `approved` (no pending/self-serve) |
| `notifications` | ✅ | Only `email` channel, `pending` → `sent` |
| `audit_entries` | ✅ | Write-only for MVP (no query UI yet) |
| `locations` | ❌ | Single-site assumption for MVP |
| `positions` | ❌ | Role-agnostic shifts work without positions |
| `skills` | ❌ | No qualification validation in MVP |
| `shift_swap_requests` | ❌ | No swap workflow in MVP |
| `time_off_requests` | ❌ | Deferred with time-off feature |
| `clock_entries` | ❌ | Deferred |
| `integrations` | ❌ | Deferred |
| `feature_flags` | ❌ | Deferred |
| `compliance_violations` | ❌ | Deferred |
| `region_routing` | ❌ | Phase D feature |

### Schema Simplifications for MVP

```sql
-- shift_assignments: no pending/approval flow. Manager assigns directly.
-- status is always 'approved' for MVP.
ALTER TABLE shift_assignments DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS status;
ALTER TABLE shift_assignments DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS requested_at;
ALTER TABLE shift_assignments DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS approved_by;

-- shifts: no draft/published workflow for MVP.
-- All shifts are immediately visible once created.
-- Drop 'draft' from the enum, default to 'published'.

-- notifications: only email channel for MVP.
-- Remove 'in_app' from notification_channel enum.

-- people: remove subscription_token, data_exported_at for MVP.
```

## Backend Implementation Notes (MVP)

### Authentication
- Session tokens stored in database, not JWT (allows invalidation).
- No refresh tokens for MVP (session lasts 7 days, extend on use).
- No password reset for MVP (admin can reset via direct support).

### RBAC (Simplified for MVP)
- 3 roles: `company_admin`, `manager`, `employee`.
- `super_admin` is a database-level role, no UI.
- Permission check is a simple middleware: `requireRole('manager')`.
- No `role_permissions` join table for MVP — permissions are hardcoded by role in middleware.

```typescript
// MVP RBAC: hardcoded role hierarchy
const roleHierarchy = {
    employee: 0,
    manager: 1,
    company_admin: 2,
};
// A user with role X can access any endpoint requiring role <= X.
```

### Shift Publishing (Simplified)
- No "draft" state for MVP.
- When manager clicks "Publish":
  1. For each active template, expand RRULE for the target week.
  2. Create shift rows (skip already-existing dates).
  3. Return created shift IDs.
- Shifts are immediately visible to employees.
- No conflict detection UI (server throws error on double-assign, caught in save).

### Invite Flow (Simplified)
- `POST /api/v1/people` creates person with `status = 'invited'`.
- Backend sends email with a one-time token link: `/accept-invite?token=XXX`.
- Accept-invite page: set password → status becomes `active`.
- No email template customization for MVP (plain-text or basic HTML).

### Email (Simplified)
- Single transactional email provider integration.
- Two email templates: (1) Invite email, (2) Shift assigned notification.
- Send synchronously during API request (no queue for MVP — acceptable at small scale).
- Retry: attempt send, log failure, show error to user if email fails.

### Audit Log (Write-Only)
- All writes to people, teams, shifts, assignments are logged.
- No audit log UI in MVP.
- HMAC chain is fully implemented as designed.

### Calendar View (Simplified)
- Week view only (no month or day) for MVP.
- Shifts render as horizontal bars in a 7-column grid.
- Single timezone: company timezone. No toggle.
- Employee view: read-only. Manager view: click shift → assign modal.
- Fully server-rendered or single-page app — tech choice deferred.

## Data Flow: Shift Publishing (Critical Path)

```
Manager clicks "Publish Week of Jul 13"
  │
  ├─ 1. GET /api/v1/teams/:teamId/shift-templates?is_active=true
  │     → Returns templates with recurrence_rules
  │
  ├─ 2. For each template:
  │     ├─ Parse RRULE with library
  │     ├─ Expand for range (Jul 13 00:00:00Z to Jul 19 23:59:59Z)
  │     ├─ Exclude dates already in shifts table (template_id + start_at)
  │     └─ INSERT each new shift row
  │
  ├─ 3. Return list of created shifts
  │
  └─ 4. Frontend re-renders schedule grid
```

## Excluded from MVP (Will Break)

| Scenario | Why Not Handled | When It Will Break |
|---|---|---|
| Employee works multiple teams | Cross-team assign deferred | Won't appear on secondary team schedule |
| Shift spans midnight | Stored as UTC, rendered same day | May appear on wrong day in calendar |
| DST transition week | Single company TZ, basic rendering | Might show 1-hour offset visually |
| Employee clock in/out | Feature deferred | No time tracking at all |
| 500+ employees per company | No pagination for MVP | Browser may lag loading all shifts |
| Mobile browsing | No responsive design for MVP | Layout breaks on small screens |
| Email delivery failure | No queue, no retry | User sees error, shift still saved |
| Manager leaves company | No reassignment flow | Team has no manager |
| Two managers edit same shift | No optimistic locking | Last write wins |

Each of these gets addressed in the post-MVP roadmap below.

---

## Post-MVP Roadmap

After the employee can see their schedule, the natural progression follows the employee's relationship with their shifts over time: **before → during → after** their shift happens.

```

### Phase A: Before the Shift

After an employee sees their schedule, they need **control** over it before the shift happens.

#### A1: Self-Scheduling (Employee picks shifts)

**The problem**: Manager spends hours assigning every shift manually. Employees have no say.

**The feature**:
- Employee visits "Available Shifts" tab → sees unassigned shifts for their team
- Clicks a shift → "Request Shift" → pending badge on calendar
- Manager sees a "Requests" queue grouped by shift
- Manager approves/denies in bulk (select all, approve)
- Auto-assign fallback: if nobody requests by cutoff, manager assigns manually
- Notifications: employee gets email on approval or denial

**Employee UX**:
```
  Available Shifts ─ Engineering ─ Jul 13-19
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Mon 13  │ Tue 14  │ Wed 15  │ Thu 16  │ Fri 17     │
│         │         │         │         │            │
│ 08:00   │ 08:00   │ 08:00   │ 08:00   │ 08:00      │
│ [Pick]  │ [Pick]  │ [Pick]  │ [Pick]  │ [Pick]     │
│         │         │         │         │            │
│ 16:00   │ 16:00   │ 16:00   │         │            │
│ [Pick]  │ [Pick]  │ [Pick]  │         │            │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Why this order**: Self-scheduling is the highest-value feature after basic schedule viewing. It saves managers hours per week and gives employees agency.

#### A2: Calendar Export (iCal + Webcal)

**The problem**: Employee has to open the app to check their schedule. They want it in their existing calendar (Google, Apple, Outlook).

**The feature**:
- "Export" button on My Schedule page
- Option 1: Download `.ics` file — imports as static events
- Option 2: Copy webcal URL — paste into any calendar app for live sync
- Secret subscription token per person (rotate-able)
- Changes to schedule auto-update via webcal poll

**Why this order**: After self-scheduling, employees have an active, changing schedule. Export makes it accessible without opening the app.

#### A3: Notifications Upgrade

**The problem**: Employee forgets about a shift. Manager doesn't know about conflicts.

**The features (in priority order)**:
1. **Reminder emails**: Send X minutes before shift start (configurable per company, default 60)
2. **Daily digest**: "Tomorrow's schedule" email at 6pm
3. **Change notifications**: Email when any assigned shift changes or is cancelled
4. **Notification preferences**: Each person can opt in/out of reminder types

**Why this order**: Reminders are the most impactful (reduce no-shows), then digest (planning), then change alerts (awareness).

---

### Phase B: During the Shift

After employees can control their schedule, they need to **execute** it.

#### B1: Clock In / Out

**The problem**: Manager doesn't know who actually showed up. Payroll has no data.

**The feature**:
- Employee opens app during shift → sees "Clock In" button
- One click → timestamp recorded, button changes to "Clock Out"
- Clock Out → optional notes prompt
- Timer visible on dashboard while clocked in
- Immutable entries (cannot edit or delete)
- Grace period: configurable window before/after shift start for clock-in

#### B2: Mobile (PWA or Native)

**The problem**: Employee can't clock in from a phone browser. Manager can't approve on the go.

**The feature**:
- Responsive web or Progressive Web App (PWA) for v1
- Key mobile flows: clock in/out, view schedule, approve requests (manager)
- Push notifications for reminders and changes
- GPS location capture on clock-in (optional, configurable per company)

**Why this order**: Clock-in without mobile is desk-bound. Mobile + clock together enable real workforce management.

#### B3: Real-Time Coverage View

**The problem**: Manager sees a gap 5 minutes before shift starts and doesn't know who's available.

**The feature**:
- Live view of who is clocked in right now, by team
- Who's scheduled next (upcoming clock-ins)
- Who's available (no shift scheduled, not clocked in)
- Quick action: message available person to cover

### Phase C: After the Shift

After shifts are executed, you need to **close the loop**.

#### C1: Reports & Analytics

**The problem**: Nobody knows who worked the most, who was late, or overtime trends.

**The features**:
- **Attendance report**: Person × date range → scheduled vs actual hours, late count, no-show count
- **Overtime report**: Who exceeded weekly/daily thresholds
- **Coverage report**: % of shifts filled vs open per team per week
- **Export all reports to CSV**

**Why this order**: Managers need the data loop closed before compliance or payroll matters.

#### C2: Payroll Export

**The problem**: Payroll team manually enters hours from paper schedules.

**The feature**:
- Export hours worked (from clock entries) in a format compatible with:
  - Gusto, ADP, BambooHR (CSV template per integration)
  - Payroll API integration (post-v1 for each provider)
- Data exported: person name, date, clock in, clock out, break (future), total hours
- Manager reviews and approves hours before export

#### C3: Audit & Compliance UI

**The problem**: Company admin needs to prove compliance but can't see the audit log.

**The features**:
- Audit log page: searchable, filterable by actor, action, resource, date range
- View HMAC chain (verify integrity of log entries)
- GDPR export (person data download)
- GDPR erasure (delete person with anonymization)
- HIPAA toggle in company settings activates additional safeguards

---

### Phase D: Scale & Enterprise

After product-market fit, these unlock larger customers.

#### D1: Multi-Region Data Residency

- Companies can choose a data storage region at signup
- Data routed to EU, US, or APAC database clusters
- Required for GDPR-compliant EU companies and HIPAA US companies

#### D2: SSO / SAML / OIDC

- Enterprise single sign-on
- Supported providers: Okta, Azure AD, Google Workspace, OneLogin
- SCIM provisioning (auto-create/disable users)

#### D3: Billing & Plans

- Self-serve subscription plans (monthly per active employee)
- Stripe integration with metered billing
- Plan tiers: Free (1 team), Pro (unlimited), Enterprise (SSO, SLA)

#### D4: Public API

- Rate-limited REST API with API keys per company
- Webhooks for shift events (assign, clock, cancel)
- Integration marketplace: Slack, Teams, Discord

### Summary: Value Per Phase

| Phase | Unlocks For Employee | Unlocks For Manager | Business Value |
|---|---|---|---|
| **MVP** | See my schedule | Create + assign shifts | Core scheduling exists |
| **Phase A** | Pick my shifts, export to calendar | Self-service reduces admin work | 50% less manager time |
| **Phase B** | Clock in from anywhere | Know who actually showed up | Payroll accuracy |
| **Phase C** | See my hours | Reports, payroll export | Compliance + payroll |
| **Phase D** | — | Enterprise scale | Revenue growth |

## Estimated Effort (Guesstimate)

| Area | Backend (days) | Frontend (days) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Auth + company | 2 | 2 | Register, login, setup page |
| Teams + People CRUD | 2 | 2 | Includes invite email |
| Shift templates + RRULE | 3 | 2 | Need RRULE library integration |
| Shift expansion + publish | 2 | 1 | Core schedule logic |
| Assignments | 1 | 1 | Assign modal + backend |
| Schedule calendar view | 1 | 4 | Week grid most complex UI |
| Dashboard | 0.5 | 2 | Upcoming shifts, quick links |
| Emails | 1 | 0 | Template + send logic |
| Audit log | 1 | 0 | DB triggers only |
| Company settings | 0.5 | 0.5 | Form + API |
| Infrastructure | 2 | 1 | Deployment, DB, CI, env |
| **Total** | **16** | **15.5** | **~31 days / 6 weeks** |

## MVP Delivery Milestone

```
Week 1-2: Auth, Teams, People (infrastructure + foundation)
Week 3-4: Templates, RRULE, Shifts, Assignments (core scheduling)
Week 5:   Calendar view, Dashboard, Emails (employee experience)
Week 6:   Polish, bug fixes, deployment, internal dogfooding
```

At week 6, the app is deployed with real data from 1–2 pilot companies. After validation, the MVP+ backlog (self-scheduling, clock, export) begins.
